            That’s why we’re organizing BoilerMake, a 36-hour hackathon at Purdue where teams of students create software and hardware projects that solve important, real-world problems. BoilerMake brings together highly talented university students with top-tier companies to support the development of remarkable student projects and personal relationships.
