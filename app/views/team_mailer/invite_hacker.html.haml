On October 17-19, 500 students will join together at BoilerMake to shatter the standard model for hackathons. If challenges motivate you to perservere, if dreaming keeps you up at night, and if 'good' isn't good enough, you're exactly who we're looking for. Together, we're going to make hackathon history.
